When departments or teachers desire to micromanage students' lives - it is a very bad sign. A good teacher will let the application of the skills the student has learned, be the assessment. A good teacher is a tutor, and a nurturer. A good teacher always has his eye on his student's well-being and development. A bad teacher always has his eye on how well he's proved himself to his superiors via the assessments that he's given the students. Good teachers teach because they love watching people learn.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"Dear fellow vapers, regretfully I must announce that on Friday January 2, 2015 Whit E. Octopus Vapors will be raising its prices to $15.00 a 30ml bottle. However, we will begin offering free shipping on orders for two or more bottles.\n\nAs a community of vapers that has really helped to get the word out regarding our product I felt that you all deserved an explanation for why we have decided to start charging more. There are two primary reasons. When this company started out I was the only employee and for the last six months it has just been my brother and I filling every order that has come in. We have grown to the point where we need to begin bringing on additional help, which surprisingly enough does not come for free. The second primary reason that we are raising the prices is to help us get out ahead of the looming FDA regulations.\n\nI know that there will be many of you who are frustrated with our company and our brand for raising the prices. Believe me this was not an easy decision to make. I've been mulling over this for about three months.\n\nOur prices have always been more than reasonable, and we believe that even by raising our prices we still fall within the range of reasonable. I personally believe that the quality of juice that you receive along with our customer service is worth what we'll soon be charging. However, what I think and what is reality are often two different things.\n\nThank you all for helping my company grow and for the passionate following the we've received. So much good has come out of this and I hope that it can continue for a long time to come.\n\nAs always if you have any questions you can comment below, shoot me an email, or give me a call.","author":"wittyoctopus","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/electronic_cigarette\/comments\/2qyipi\/whit_e_octopus_vapors_announces_a_raise_in_prices\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"324ca513dc5b339588057f321278791d"},{"second_type":"question","main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"d3ff34d503cec21ac13d39d7440d5490"},{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"announcement","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_2qyipi"},{"body":"Honestly, if you buy 2 bottles with free shipping, it is roughly the same amount of money, $29 and some change, as before.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"As you can tell from the title, this situation is a little confusing. I broke up with my ex boyfriend 4 years ago (we dated 2 years), I cheated on him and told him so. It was a one time fling, but it made me realize that I wasn't happy (albeit a horrible way to do so). It took even longer to realize that how my ex had been treating me was actually not very nice, but we broke up because of the cheating.\n\n\nMy ex has made multiple attempts to reconcile with me as friends, telling me he forgives me, etc. but I have not responded. He has no clue that how he treated me was very wrong and it even makes me question my sanity.\n\n\n\nI then I have to remember that no, it is not normal to force your girlfriend to have anal even when she is crying for you to stop, and you just laugh and \"shhh\" her only to jokingly bring it up later in the relationship as something that was funny. No, it is not normal to make your girlfriend feel guilty for not wanting to indulge in some of your kinks (going as far as saying that if I loved him I would do it), telling me that he preferred anal because my vagina was too loose. Not to mention that he constantly berated me for having a big butt, \"bumpy\" skin and coarse hair. This isn't acceptable is it? Am I too sensitive?\n\n\nSo, this is where I need advice.... do I continue to ignore him? Do I tell him that I don't associate our relationship with good memories? I almost don't want to open that can of worms, because I know he will make it all about himself, but at the same time, I hate that he is going around thinking I won't respond because I am too remorseful about cheating on him. I HATE HIM. I am now with someone who loves every part of me and it is a constant reminder of how much he put me down. What do I do!?\n\n\n\n**tl;dr** Exboyfriend from 4 years ago broke up because of me cheating. He wants to remain friends, but has no clue that he was  abusive(?) and that is why I do not want to talk. Do I tell him?\n\n\n**EDIT: Thanks for all the advice, I have decided to completely ignore his message and block him from contacting me further. Like many of you have said, it seems to be a ploy and I am 100% certain he will twist it around to make me feel bad. I do not feel like dealing with that because... I don't have to.**\n","author":"throwingthisawayya","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/2xjwhw\/do_i_26f_tell_my_ex_m30_from_4_years_that_i_think\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"d0bf500c45ae7c1c08eb65ef0a4e48f9"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"e9e4b3ab355135fa954badcc06bfccc6"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"29a90e15afc16faf25337162301c0328"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_2xjwhw"},{"body":"I think the answer here is to completely ignore this ex.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"I've posted this in a few individual threads over the past year or so, and felt it was deserving of its own thread in case it can help a few more fellow Canucks save some money.\n\nI'm not affiliated with Memory Express in any way, but I have been using them quite extensively and can vouch for their service, speedy delivery, and amazing price beat policy.\n\n**Process**\n\nBasically you start with your PCPartPicker list as your normally would, but when you are ready to buy, click on every item and check to see if it's available (in-stock) at memoryexpress, even if it's not the lowest price. Add all of the available items to your cart.\n\nSometimes when I'm having trouble deciding between some items (namely RAM or motherboard) I will pick the one that's available at MemEx.\n\nWhen you are finished, go to your cart, and there will be a button next to each entry for price beat request. Go back to PCPartPicker, get the lowest price for your item, and then enter that into the \"Competitor's Price\" field. You will also need to enter the URL to the item showing the price and that it's in stock. This has to be the competitor's website, not the PCPP link.\n\nMemory Express will then beat the price by 25% of the difference. So, if NCIX is having a sale and charging $139.99 but it's regular $189.99 at MemEx, MemEx will give it to you for $127.49 ($139.99 - 25% of $50).\n\nDo this for your whole order and you will find yourself saving a few bucks on each item. If you're buying 7-8 items you can usually save about $50, sometimes less sometimes more.\n\nTheir fee for shipping is then $8.99 flat to anywhere in Canada, so you only pay 1 shipping fee.\n\n**Personal Experience**\n\n[I have purchased over $10,000 worth of items from Memory Express](http:\/\/imgur.com\/WNZ4E3N) and one of the things that pleased me the most is that I've never once been contacted because a price beat couldn't be done - and I put a price beat request on about 90% of my items. A lot of times with other places that price match they will deny it or say \"lowest we can go is X\", but MemEx has always just approved and shipped, assuming the item's price was correct and in stock. MemoryExpress' system automatically screenshots all of the pages when you submit your order, so you don't have to worry about the competitor's price or stock level changing before it's processed.\n\nI've also had to return items for RMA twice, and that process has always been quick and flawless. One was a DOA motherboard for which I received a replacement, the other was a DOA Wi-Fi adapter for which I got a full refund (no restocking fee). Both times they covered the cost of the shipping label and there was 0 hassle.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"Hello fellow HS players. My name is Kyle. I have been playing video games since I was a kid with a gameboy and I am 19 now. I have a compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, anxiety, and have issues with moderating what I do. I used to be addicted to heroin. I find that I am getting sucked into Hearthstone too much and I feel like it is taking me away from my real life as much as I am in denial to say so....\n\n This game is mindblowingly fun ain't it? Only one problem though is that I am hopelessly addicted. I find that I never get bored of this game. This is my first real TCG and I am hooked. I play HS around 5-8 hours everyday. I am a student however I usually avoid doing homework until like after midnight because I am so consumed by this game.... I know that a lot of you might say then don't play or suck it up! It is hard for me though :\/ I've uninstalled battle.net client twice and still come back to it..\n\nI have no friends that I am in close contact with at the moment so my social life is pretty horrid. This is my only escape... And I fucking have dreams about hearthstone too no joke right before I'm going to bed... I am not lying. I will like make up plays in my mind against opponents... it's sad really...\n\nDespite playing for so many hours I don't even want to know since I found this game 3-4 months ago, I only have 4-5 legendaries and haven't reached legend rank. I usually grind dailies and go straight to arena. That's my favorite, however sometimes I lose all my gold and have to grind harder. \n\nAnyways... sorry for rambling. My weekend starts today and I just wanted to see if anyone can sympathize with me? I really want to be more productive in my real life and enjoy Hearthstone at the same time... but it ain't easy for me :( \n\nIf I amounted the time I played Hearthstone into something substantial I would be very satisfied.. I have aspirations of becoming a musician and if I spent 1\/5 of the time I do playing HS on it I would get a lot of stuff done...\n\nwould love some feedback. Is it time for a break? I always come back tho :( I am having fun tho right?\n\n**edit:thanks for all the sweet replies. Don't know why some people downvoted a serious question lol. But I appreciate all the answers they were helpful. Will try to follow them tomorrow and see how it goes. My battletag is Synthetic#1634 if anyone wants to chat.

You need to set rules for your gaming. Luckily Hearthstone is a game that is easy to play in small amounts as well (I'm referring to the fact that HS has short games, and even full arena runs don't usually take that long.)\n\nYou should think about some increments you could play at a time, and then focus on something else. Maybe one game, two games, three games? An arena run? Whatever you decide on, keep true to it. Play at most that, and then set a timer for 30 minutes or so whilst you focus on something else. When the alarm rings, repeat. :)\n\nI know how addiction works and it can be hard. But if you could quit heroin, I know you can do it!\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, I'm here. Feel free to pm me.

And you will see it once you read it, it's really obvious. here is the message:\n\nHello Summoner,\n\nThere has been a high volume of post-game reports against you relative to the number of games you've played. We have investigated your account and found higher than average levels of toxicity as a result of your actions in the matches you play. As a result, we have decided to place a series of chat restrictions on your account to help you adjust your behavior in game.\n\nThe Tribunal is currently in extended recess while our development teams work on a number of improvements to the system. In the meantime we will be using chat restrictions to moderate and reform behavior in League of Legends.\n\nPlease keep in mind that failure to adjust your behavior may result in more chat restrictions and possibly in-game bans in the future.\n\nFor more information about chat restrictions, check out our Knowledge Base:\n\nhttps:\/\/riotgames.zendesk.com\/entries\/23395906\n\nAlso, we have begun a new initiative to restrict players from the ranked queue. Ranked Restrictions have a higher threshold for punishment compared to chat restrictions and require more reports and evidence of toxicity. Please bear in mind that not all chat restricted players will receive a ranked restriction.\n\nDuring the time of the ranked restriction, you will need to complete a number of Normal Draft games. After the required number of Normal Draft games has been played, your account will be reviewed again to see if there was an improvement in your behavior. The restriction on the ranked queue will continue if this is not the case.\n\nThis is a good time to re-evaluate in game behavior because if it will not change in the future, harsher punishments will follow. These may include timed suspensions or removal of ranked rewards.\n\nWe have also announced that players who have high amounts of toxicity in their games will not receive their ranked rewards. This system is not currently active, but will be turned on in the following weeks. At this time, we are not able to tell you if you qualify for the removal of rewards. Not every player with ranked restrictions will be punished in this way; only the worst offenders will be affected. If you're concerned about being affected by this feature, I recommend being on your best behavior in the coming weeks.\n\nFor more information about this system, feel free to check out the forum post and FAQ below:\n\nhttp:\/\/boards.na.leagueoflegends.com\/en\/c\/miscellaneous\/1LJP1ovA-ranked-restrictions \nhttps:\/\/support.leagueoflegends.com\/entries\/55968134-Ranked-Restrictions\n\nCharlie Saber \nRiot Games Player Support","post_depth":4,"author":"SouliG","majority_link":"t1_cm2bm64","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t1_cm2bm64","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t1_cm2bm64","annotator":"5d63b12e3a79e9d874e585dd1887b8d9"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t1_cm2bm64","annotator":"29a90e15afc16faf25337162301c0328"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t1_cm2bm64","id":"t1_cm2bxbb"},{"body":"Lol, what are you talking about.

Most modern web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome use \"rendering engines\" to parse the DOM (Document Object Model). These engines are commonly written in C++ because it is a powerful language, and is OS independent in most cases. Here's a list of the commonly used rendering engines:\n\n* Chrome - Blink (a special type of WebKit)\n\n* Firefox - Gecko \n\n* Safari - WebKit\n\n* Opera - Blink \n\n* IE - Trident\n\nEDIT: Thanks \/u\/adamnemecek for pointing out Opera's rendering engine\n\nAdditionally, there are \"Javascript Interpreters.\" Javascript is an actual programming language unlike  HTML\/CSS since it has variables, control structure, functions, objects, etc. One of the fastest Js engines built is the V8 engine, which is programmed in C++. The V8 project is [open source](https:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/v8\/).\n\nThese variations are also what makes some browsers \"faster\" than others. They have different components or \"engines\" which deal with things in different ways. It is completely possible that a browser could play the latest WebGL 3D games at high speeds and still be slow at loading websites. (Although no such thing exists).\n\n\nQ: What are W3C and WHATWG?\n\nA: W3C and WHATWG play a smaller role in this than you might think. All they do is decide what \"modern\" web code should look and function like. What is useful about these organizations is that they provide a unified platform for browser developers to build off of. For example, W3C has decided that HTML should look like so:\n\n    <html>\n\n    <body><\/body>\n\n    <\/html>\n\nBy using this, Google can teach Chrome to understand what all this plaintext means, so that it can successfully render it in the browser. W3C standards are also taken rather loosely in some situations. A while ago, it was once necessary to include this at the start of a document:\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n\nBut now, browsers are smarter at recognizing what the document is without the coder having to say. Another example:\n\n    <script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"path\/to\/file\">\n\nNow you no longer have to declare `text\/javascript`, because modern browsers will be able to tell what the file is. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that web \"standards\" are always changing and browsers can choose to adapt to them if they want to be useful. As for programmers, we want our code to be compatible with all the modern browsers so more users can access our websites, therefore we should write W3C compliant code. \n\nHope that cleared it up, let me know if you need any more clarity. Also, I suggest reading [this](http:\/\/www.html5rocks.com\/en\/tutorials\/internals\/howbrowserswork\/) article. \n\n\n","post_depth":1,"author":"Carpetfizz","majority_link":"t3_1tgh62","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1tgh62","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1tgh62","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1tgh62","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_1tgh62","id":"t1_ce7ry21"},{"body":"That is one awesome explanation, many thanks, I'll read the article later tonight since I'm on my phone now, wish I had gold to give you :(","post_depth":2,"author":"kmelkon","majority_link":"t1_ce7ry21","annotations":[{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t1_ce7ry21","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t1_ce7ry21","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t1_ce7ry21","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"appreciation","in_reply_to":"t1_ce7ry21","id":"t1_ce7tgvv"},{"body":"No worries, glad to help :)","post_depth":3,"author":"Carpetfizz","majority_link":"t1_ce7tgvv","annotations":[{"main_type":"other","link_to_post":"t1_ce7tgvv","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t1_ce7tgvv","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t1_ce7tgvv","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"appreciation","in_reply_to":"t1_ce7tgvv","id":"t1_ce7tky8"},{"body":"There are multiple tools used to describe languages.

The modern development of the languages probably is not that similar to the original engineering, which had to solve more problems. It's not inconceivable that the original engineering was based on some company-mandated (I believe HTML was produced for work???) flow-chart or markup language.\n\nThese days, design in some parts may consist of: here is a new features, this is how it is spelled, this is how you calculate it, these are the standards for its interchange.

I will encourage them to go on dates to the movies etc with other people of the same sex and take them to LGBT youth groups to meet future boy\/girlfriends.\n\nI want to do this because I'm fed up of homosexuality being seen as wrong, unusual etc. and supposedly heterosexuality is the norm. \n\nI also want to prove that homosexuality may not be genetic - it can be taught, because we're all fed the lies that a man and a woman is normal etc.\n\nThe only problem is that my family say they will shun me if I go ahead with it as they consider it to be abuse (they have no idea of the word obviously) and my friends said it wouldn't work anyway.\n\nThe ultimate question is whether a criminal offence would have been committed by raising my children like this?","author":"BeGayOkay","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit.com\/comments\/isatg\/i_have_decided_to_raise_my_child_to_be_gay_it_is\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"440ce79c0e6e377d44b1f9c585154a1f"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_isatg"},{"body":"obvious troll is obvious.","post_depth":1,"author":"-Borfo-","majority_link":"t3_isatg","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"humor","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"440ce79c0e6e377d44b1f9c585154a1f"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_isatg","id":"t1_c268hn1"},{"body":"Pretty much.","post_depth":2,"author":"cheezymadman","majority_link":"t1_c268hn1","annotations":[{"main_type":"agreement","link_to_post":"t1_c268hn1","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"agreement","link_to_post":"t1_c268hn1","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t1_c268hn1","annotator":"440ce79c0e6e377d44b1f9c585154a1f"}],"majority_type":"agreement","in_reply_to":"t1_c268hn1","id":"t1_c268i3k"},{"body":"lets just wait for the day when those poor kids have to tell their parents that they are in fact, straight.","post_depth":1,"author":"bluesonic","majority_link":"t3_isatg","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"humor","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"440ce79c0e6e377d44b1f9c585154a1f"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_isatg","id":"t1_c268k8l"},{"body":"excuse me? well to be honest i have come to expect childish \"obvious troll\" comments from redditors... but what is wrong with educating my child so that they can make a clear decision in life without social consequence","post_depth":1,"author":"BeGayOkay","majority_link":"t3_isatg","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t1_c268hn1","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t3_isatg","annotator":"440ce79c0e6e377d44b1f9c585154a1f"}],"in_reply_to":"t3_isatg","id":"t1_c268s7p"}],"subreddit":"reddit.com","title":"I have decided to raise my child to be gay.

They go to fund the government\n\nWhen will I need to pay them? \n\n- When you started work they had you complete something called a W-4 form. It tells your employer how much they should withhold in taxes to send along. Generally for a part time fast food gig when you are 16 you will get most of that back when you file your taxes. \n\nShould I open a bank account? \n\n- Yes and most likely ask your company to setup direct deposit. (Your manager can help you with that). Without a bank account it will be harder to cash your paycheck.

After a month you should get a general idea of how much your monthly pay is- once you have that take out fixed expenses like cell phone bill (if you pay that) or $ for food. Once that's been taken out, pay yourself first - meaning put $ in a bank account and don't touch it unless you have to- this money will fund your goal (school\/car\/emergency fund). After that if you have any left over, spend or save it. Goodluck!

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"I spent most of the last seven or so years being really good friends with a guy. He was an awesome best friend.\n\n\nWe then dated and what I assumed would be a fairytale turned into a horror story of repeated breakups and childish behaviour (on both of our parts but a couple of particularly unkind actions on his). In his defence, it was his first relationship ever. He would frequently refuse to apologise, threaten to break up with me over tiny things, or cancel plans.\n\n\nWe eventually broke up just before we were due to move in together. He changed his mind and I was left scrambling for someone to live. I was hurt and furious - but begged for him back - he said no - I went no contact.\n\n\nFast forward six months and I regret losing him altogether. We meet up a couple of times. He tells me he regrets his childish behaviour, I was the love of his life, he regrets his actions and thinks that if he hadn't behaved so immaturely, we might still be together. I apologise too. He mentions us living together in the future with some other friends.\n\n\nI know I love him and I haven't been able to move on. I seem to have loved him for a long time.\n\n\nBut - I want children, he doesn't. He seems firm about this. Our conversation basically ended on the note that although we still have feelings for each other, we know we're not compatible because of the issue over kids. Therefore the most we can be is friends. Last night he messaged me to tell me he missed me and I told him I was worried about both of us getting hurt.\n\n\nAny advice please?\n\ntldr: ex-boyfriend changes his tune and apologises for all of his past actions - but he still wants a different life from the one I do.\n\n\n\n   \n**tl;dr**: Mandatory summary\/question!","author":"crestsofgildedhonour","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/3i98uc\/me_29_f_with_my_ex_28_m_15_years_says_he_regrets\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"e9e4b3ab355135fa954badcc06bfccc6"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"fd6076bf357438af2eab3af408e80dd9"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_3i98uc"},{"body":"Childish behavior aside, children isn't something you can compromise on.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"I didn't really know in which subreddit to post this so I hope this is the right one. If not, just let me know and I can move it. \n\nSo I'm just going to start out by saying I got the short end of the stick when it comes to mental health. I've been diagnosed bipolar 2 along with BPD, and I had an abusive relationship in the past which still weighs on me heavily sometimes. \n\nSo my boyfriend is pretty much the best SO you can have. He's intelligent, funny, and we share a lot of the same interests. We've been friends since we were children so we know each other very well, and he never treats me with anything but love and respect. We've been dating for almost 2 years now. I know that we are young but we share a very deep bond, especially because he's been so understanding with all of my mental problems. \n\nThe problem comes from my side. People with BPD are known to have separation anxiety when it comes to their SOs. I've realized that when we haven't spent physical time together I get very moody. I feel like I always want to be physically close to him. And I know that it's impossible to be next to him all the time, but I still want it. We just came back from a week-long vacation with his family (they've become my second family and I love them), and I'm taking not being with him every second really hard. I miss falling asleep next to him and I just feel so lonely. I'm tearing up writing this and I don't even know why. \n\nSo I need your help, Reddit. I don't want to be the clingy girlfriend, but I really don't know how to cope with not being physically close to him. The last thing I want to do is trap him, especially because he's a very free, happy-go-lucky guy. What do I do?\n\nAlso yes, I have communicated a lot of this to him. He's very good and stays relatively close to me in public settings because I can get overwhelmed and when I'm sad he just hugs me. He knows that's what I need to feel loved. But I don't think he knows the full extent of this. \n\nTL;DR: I've basically got the best damn boyfriend ever but I don't know how to cope with being away from him. \n","author":"Throwaway_8991319","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/46u17h\/i_18f_need_help_dealing_with_separation_anxiety\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"fd6076bf357438af2eab3af408e80dd9"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"1b6842f6994d0e1dd00c2b611793d268"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_46u17h"},{"body":"I know it's very easy to \"cling\" and want to be around someone 24\/7, but try to remember that time alone is also good for you, and it makes the time you spend with him more special. \n\nI know what you mean, and I know the exact feeling you're describing, because I've experienced it--I think it's pretty common, and admitting to it means you know it's an issue for you, so you should work on it. For me, I'll distract myself when the guy isn't around, and I'll tell myself I can only check my phone once every half hour or so. \n\nI'll give myself tasks, like organizing my room, cleaning the bathroom, getting homework done, etc. Things that need to get done anyway, and require my full attention. It keeps me distracted, and makes me more productive! Anything that keeps you from being on your phone (checking it, or blowing his up) is a good thing!\n\nTry getting lost in a good book, starting a new series on Netflix, or hanging out with some other friends. A shopping trip by yourself can be a good way to unwind, too. If possible, pick up extra hours at work--this means more money for you, and less time to blow his phone up or overthink anything.\n\nI'm glad you have an understanding boyfriend, but remember, smothering anyone will eventually take its toll.

I'll list a few.\n\n* Function. Different types of languages are better at some things, worse at others. For example, FORTRAN was designed to be optimal for scientific computation (FORmula TRANslation). COBOL, on the other hand, was built for business operations (COmmon Business Oriented Language). Other languages are good at other things- instruction (BASIC, Haskell), speed and optimization of code (C, C++), and so forth.\n* Platform. Different computer systems came with their own operating systems, and they had not only different hardware architecture, but in some cases radically different ways of managing memory, input and output and display. They were frequently designed for specific applications and the languages used on these platforms expressed that application.\n* Use. Different languages work better in a different context. For example, if you're writing web applications you'll be better off using a language suited for that environment. You'll have a very hard time writing a web app in C++, for example.\n* Design. As computer science matures, we discover new ways of doing things. Back in the days when languages like FORTRAN, COBOL and C were dominant, we didn't have any concept of object-oriented programming. Turbo Pascal 4 brought that to the masses, and OOP took off. Now we have different ways of looking at data and structures, which in order to work require languages capable of expressing those concepts. It's frequently better to build a new system that uses these concepts from the ground up than to try and make something built as a totally different language work with a new paradigm.\n\n","post_depth":1,"author":"corey_m_snow","majority_link":"t3_2sivr7","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2sivr7","annotator":"d5b31a90453980e00563f529fc590228"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2sivr7","annotator":"d3ff34d503cec21ac13d39d7440d5490"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2sivr7","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_2sivr7","id":"t1_cnpupu8"},{"body":"Different languages are better geared for handling different types of problems.

For instance, a functional language like Haskel is going to be very different from a procedural language like C, which is very different again from an object-oriented language like Java.  These different types of languages force you to use very different approaches to how you solve problems with them, and some people may fine one type of approach easier to understand than another.\n\nAlso, individual computer scientists often end up being dissatisfied with some aspect of an existing language, and will create a new language that addresses what they perceive as its shortfalls.

I kind of woke up and felt her next to me. It took a moment to register but, when it did, I jumped up. This woke her up.

I went to the gym every day, started eating healthy, and even my marks in school shot up.\n \nI used to weight 285 pounds, and never could I of imagined losing even 20 pounds. 6 months later I've lost 85 pounds, gained a huge amount of self confidence, and I still manage to smoke a bowl here and there with my ent buddies on my new night schedule. I'm happier than I've ever been and I just wanted to share my story with you!\n\nThere are many factors to this life style change, none I would dare say helped me more than another, but I will say this; trees have saved a depressed, sad, fat kid from an early grave, and by that I am unbelievably thankful.

In your case, it sounds like you would want a motherboard with a good amount of SATA ports so you can run many drives in RAID. The UP4 is a highly recommended motherboard on the enthusiast level X79 platform. It includes a ton of SATA ports so you can run your PC as a home server.\n2. The best video card available is debatable. Both Nvidia and AMD have flagship cards that are very strong performers. Nvidia's flagship cards are the 690 and Titan. The 690 is two 680 GPUs on one board. The Titan is the fastest single GPU card on the market. They're priced similarly, and the 690 outperforms the Titan, but the 690 can only run in 2-way SLI while the Titan can run in 4-way SLI. Nvidia just recently released its new 700 series cards, the 770 and 780. The 780 uses the same GPU as the Titan, but is cut down just a little bit. Benchmarks show it performing VERY similarly to the Titan in many games. \nOn AMD's side, their flagship cards are the 7970 GHz and the 7990. The 7970 Ghz is a very strong card, beating out Nvidia's previous top card, the 680, especially at higher resolutions. The 7990 is two 7970 GHz edition GPUs on one PCB, similar to the 690. iirc, the 7990 is the fastest card out right now. However, there's been some issues with AMD's multi card solution right now in the form of bad \"frame ratings.\" You can google that and it'll bring up a bunch of recent articles explaining it. I really recommend the GTX 780 right now in any high end rig.\n3.  GDDR5 RAM is really only on video cards. I wouldn't worry about that. I added 32 GB of DDR3 RAM to the example build because you said you were doing software development. More\/faster RAM can help speed up things like compiling. Generally, for gaming builds, 8GB is what's recommended. Some take 16GB for things like video editing.\n4.  PCIe SSD's are fast, but I wouldn't recommend them because of their price. If you want fast read\/write speeds for temporary storage, you should look into RAMdisks, in which case you might want more RAM.\n5.  The 3930k is pretty much the top of the line, consumer CPU. There's faster, but they're not really practical in most uses as they're upwards of $1000.\n6.  Multiple monitors. You should definitely look into 1440p as well.\n7.  Scythe Gentle Typhoons perform very well on radiators.\n\n\nSorry for the formatting, especially in #2. Line breaks break the numbered list formatting. I definitely would not recommend building this in mineral oil. There's really no cooling benefit to it.

THAT IS DETAILED! Thank you very much!. I'll look into ALL of that. I was only expecting some names of brands and possibly a product people liked! Wouldn't the mineral oil with pump and radiator keep the CPU cooler than the CPU Cooler though? Since the case is an aquarium, I can't really have internal hard disks, and I should've mentioned it. Most likely I would have one of those hard disk type towers that sit next to the case.  \n\n1. As I don't know much at all about motherboards, the UP4 I'll have to research. I think I saw it has 4 PCIe slots and they allow for double-width cards. That 'sounds' sufficient.\n2. WOW! You really know your graphics cards. I am going to have to re-read that a couple times with Google open when I have some free time to better understand everything. That is a lot to take in and very resourceful!\n3. Ah. That explains why PS4 I guess will be having it. Yes, my career is in programming so I don't know exactly HOW MUCH ram I will need eventually, but since the motherboard supports up to 64gb, 32 should be more than enough for right now. Is there any real difference in companies for ram, or just stick with what you linked?\n4. But EXCEPT for price.... how fast are we talking ;) I thought 100gb or less would be enough just to keep OS on for boot purposes, then of course still have the other hard disks for a RAID. I have never seen the configuration so I don't know how it all works.\n5. i7 3930k. Sounds good to me\n6. 1440p? Why is that? And of course I'm going multiple monitors though.\n7.

You may want to edit the link into the post.\n\nMineral oil doesn't dissipate heat very well. You'll have a decent starting temperature, but it'll slowly climb. In a high end rig like this, you should definitely look into a custom watercooling loop. Its a big task, and will cost a pretty penny, but if you really want to overclock and push your components, there's not really any practical ways to get better temps. If you don't plan on overclocking too far, a closed loop water cooler like the Swiftech H220 is the best option. They're almost maintenance free and fairly easy to install.\n\n1.  The UP4 is a solid board. Definitely do some research though to see if it would fill your needs or if you'd be better off going with another option.\n2.  Some sites to look out for during your googling are Anandtech, HiTechLegion, Tom's Hardware, Hexus.net, and Legit Reviews.\n3. I'd actually recommend going with a 4x8GB kit of DDR3-1866 RAM. This would give you a the same 32GB of RAM now, with the option to upgrade to that 64GB of RAM later on. The company isn't really an issue, but there's difference in models that could make one kit slow down. Its generally recommended to grab two of the same kits so that there's no compatibility issues.\n4. Honestly, I can't recommend them. We're talking about $600 for a 240GB drive. If you were building some crazy server, they'd be a great option, but they're not really meant for desktops. PCIe SSDs generally bench at a around 2x the speeds of a normal SSD, but I have no experience with them so I can't really say whether or not you'd see any real-world benefit out of using one. RAMdisk is more practical, but its not permanent storage. They're generally used as scratch disks for temporary files. If you want quick access to a file while working on another project, you'll be able to access it instantly. The downsides to RAMdisks are that you're limited to whatever partition of RAM you're using as a disk, you're giving up program use of that partition, and you lose whatever is on the RAMdisk when you power off, so you need to move the files from there to a permanent location before shutting down.\n5. \n6.  1440p is just a higher resolution. [Here's an image](http:\/\/hometheaterreview.com\/images\/1440p_video_resolution.gif) giving you a little explanation to how much more screen you get. 2560x1440 monitors usually come in 27 or 30\" models and will run you around $400 each. Some people use a 1440p monitor as their primary desktop and have 1080p monitors surrounding it.\n7.  Corsair's not a bad choice. They're definitely among the most attractive fans and priced well, but they're a little lacking. They're a little loud and don't perform as well as other fans. Gentle Typhoons are consistently near the top of the charts when it comes to radiator purposed, static pressure fans. Some other suggestions are Gelid Wings, Noctua NF-F12's, and Silverstone AP 123's.\n\nOh, and the case was just a stand-in. I would not recommend that case, but choosing a case is mostly preference.","post_depth":3,"author":"HASHTAG_CUTFORBIEBER","majority_link":"t1_caenawd","annotations":[{"second_type":"answer","main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_1fwzqs","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t1_caenawd","annotator":"5d63b12e3a79e9d874e585dd1887b8d9"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t1_caenawd","annotator":"1e9ad21c83707aa8b5ec8b36002c89a4"}],"majority_type":"elaboration","in_reply_to":"t1_caenawd","id":"t1_caenk3b"},{"body":"Ah.

Examples of this would be Lux, Brand, Vel'koz, Xerath, etc... The reason for this is that you have an instant blink with no cast time, meaning you can dodge their important skillshots quickly (Lux snare, Brand pillar or Q\/ Vel'koz knock up, Xerath stun) and go in on them when they don't have their CC ability. Your main job is to be an assassin so it's better if you're against someone who's really squishy, instead of someone like Swain mid for example.\n\nI don't play Talon that much, but some simple tips are:\n\n* Your Q is an auto reset. Utilize that fact for the maximum damage. As a result, your combo should be something like: E > Auto > Q > W > R while throwing an ignite in there somewhere.\n* Your ultimate gives movement speed. Just keep this in mind.\n* If you get a Hydra, there is a trick you can do with gromp. By standing next to the wall where the Gromp is, you can use the Hydra active to make it aggro onto you and auto you over the wall. This gives you vision of the gromp and you can jump over with your E onto the gromp and escape (or chase).

So yeah you can jump him around that time. \n\nAt lvl 6 this match up gets a bit tricky. Your e places you directly behind him and he can then just use his ult to throw you in his tower. So most likely you will need flash if you want to all in him at full hp. If you don't want to all in him with your full combo when he is full hp then you can poke him down to like 75% of his hp and then destroy him with all of your kit even if he throws you directly under his tower.\n\nExhaust doesn't do much early and mid game to him as he can gladly trade his whole combo for an exhaust and all in you later, since azir without ignite has no way to kill a Talon (at least alone) unless talon does a huge mistake. \n\nWhen you get Tiamat just shove the wave in and roam and try to be fast while doing so because azir is probably one of the faster tower destroyers (from the mage champions of course).\n\nThe main thing to remember here is to abuse the time where he uses his w-q combo offensively or to farm.

When you're fighting a Handlock you know that if you bring them too low, they're going to drop Moltens, taunt up, and maybe even toss in a Healbot to add insult to injury.  So instead you bring them to a certain point and burn them out in one turn.\n\nThe same applies to Reno, except there's no specific number to work around and you don't need to stop attacking face.  You just don't want to blow any kind of burst damage until you can kill them in one turn, especially in a deck with finite and specific damage.\n\nNow, some decks just don't have any burst either due to class cards or lack of room for them.  The way to fight Reno with one of these decks is to make it so Reno won't save them.  For instance, as Flood Zoo you can lay out a board full of minions, Reliquary Seekers, and top it off with Loatheb.  Now it doesn't really matter if he drops Reno or not, it didn't do anything about your winning board state.\n\nThat said, if you're playing Oil Rogue, you should easily be able to build up ~15 damage of burst in hand.  Oil Rogue is particularly favored against most variants of Paladin since healing doesn't prevent burst, only armor does, and Rogue has many answers to Silver Hand Recruits.  I can't imagine this changes against Reno Paladin when played correctly.\n\nThe bottom line is, a Reno deck seeks to win through either value or fatigue.  Rogue can't win either of these games.  You have to take control and make the game about tempo, because if you start making anti tempo plays, you hand the advantage back to your Reno opponent.","post_depth":1,"author":"pikpikcarrotmon","majority_link":"t3_3v6z65","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"e9e4b3ab355135fa954badcc06bfccc6"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_3v6z65","id":"t1_cxl3u0b"},{"body":"I just want to bask in the glory of this problem!\n\nNo offense to the OP, but for us control players, we have waited a long time for this!","post_depth":1,"author":"Absynthexx","majority_link":"t3_3v6z65","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"e9e4b3ab355135fa954badcc06bfccc6"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"appreciation","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"appreciation","in_reply_to":"t3_3v6z65","id":"t1_cxkunsd"},{"body":"It has begun... once fun and original, now the complain train has started, 2 month and we are at the \"blizzard doesnt care\" stage","post_depth":1,"author":"Kolima25","majority_link":"t3_3v6z65","annotations":[{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"e9e4b3ab355135fa954badcc06bfccc6"},{"main_type":"other","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t3_3v6z65","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"negativereaction","in_reply_to":"t3_3v6z65","id":"t1_cxkuupg"},{"body":"This thread isn't a complaint thread, it's an advice thread on how to counter a deck.

That was apparently too subtle a jab, so some versions have the word \"DARWIN\" inside the fish to make it clear.\n\nI'd advise against this as a tattoo.

There's a growing voice that is attempting to shift the blame away from religion and towards human nature.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I've seen the old, \"There are plenty of nice theists. It's not the religion, it's the individual person. There are also mean, bitter atheists.\"\n\nSure, that entire quote is completely true. It's also COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT. We KNOW that people can be assholes regardless of declared philosophy. We KNOW that being irrational doesn't mean that somebody lacks empathy or compassion. We KNOW that being religious, or non-religious doesn't make you a better person. These are all beside the point.\n\nThe point is, sometime, we will have to work together. That's why we have rationalism in the first place. IF we can agree on the facts, then we can move forward and cooperate together towards common goals. Faith just fucks up the whole system. You can't refute, verify, test, or quantify faith claims. Faith allow erroneous, irrelevant, asinine, uninformed, inaccurate, sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful claims to pass as \"justified\" and it shouldn't.\n\nThe only way we can communicate ideas is through reason and faith is unreasonable.\n\nTheism is a just a particular subset of non-rational world-views. It's just a flagship issue for a larger problem. We need to be rational, else the best we can hope for is lucky guesses.\n\nPeople can be bad or good but that doesn't erase the philosophical issues with anti-rational stances.","author":"MellowMelon","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/comments\/we3sd\/religions_not_the_problem_people_are_the_problem\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"1b6842f6994d0e1dd00c2b611793d268"}],"majority_type":"announcement","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_we3sd"},{"body":"No, people with religion are the problem.","post_depth":1,"author":"MAtheist_","majority_link":"t3_we3sd","annotations":[{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t3_we3sd","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t3_we3sd","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t3_we3sd","annotator":"1b6842f6994d0e1dd00c2b611793d268"}],"majority_type":"disagreement","in_reply_to":"t3_we3sd","id":"t1_c5cj3qw"},{"body":"No people who have closed their minds for whatever reason are the problem.\n\n(including atheists)","post_depth":2,"majority_link":"t1_c5cj3qw","annotations":[{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t1_c5cj3qw","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t1_c5cj3qw","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t1_c5cj3qw","annotator":"1b6842f6994d0e1dd00c2b611793d268"}],"majority_type":"disagreement","in_reply_to":"t1_c5cj3qw","id":"t1_c5cjtl4"},{"body":"Being open minded does not mean placating religious people, though.

I have been a little bit weary of the company since we started our dealings with them due to lateness, bad communication, etc. but this is starting to set off alarms.\n\nOnce we are moved in, things are smooth over the next couple of months as our dealings with the company's representatives are minimal however, last week my brother (whose name the rent bank account is in) looks at a PDF rendering of our December 2015 and January 2016 rent cheques and notices that someone from the rental company has changed the payee on the cheques and signed MY initials.\n\nThis causes both my brother and I a fair bit of outrage as you can all imagine.  We decide that we do not want to deal with this company any further.  My brother has opened a fraud investigation with the bank and they have agreed that the initials look forged and are willing to credit back the cheques to our account.\n\nMy question to you all is:  While our lease is set to expire at the end of April, what are the possible outcomes if we decide to hold the December and January rents hostage (charged back to our rent account) in order to force the company's hand and terminate our lease at the end of February?\n\nWould a rental company go to court over ~$3300?\n\nAny input is appreciated!","author":"Throwaway01031990","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/445u1i\/help_condo_rental_problem\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"4400a37586eae74b5d254c81cd70e4a9"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"31ac59c1734c1547d4d0723ff254c247"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"5d63b12e3a79e9d874e585dd1887b8d9"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_445u1i"},{"body":"I don't think you should hold rent.

Increased competition. Prices did rise, but then competitors made $1 menus and such, McD's followed suit to stay competitive.  \n3. They advertise the dollar menu, but know that most people may go in for the value, but be swayed by the other items.  \n4. Computers and automation have allowed a lot of streamlining of their product chains and food production, other lower costs means they didn't need to raise prices as much.  \n5. People pay attention to the main food item to judge cost, so having the $1 menu makes people perceive the whole place as less expensive than it is.  \n6. People rarely buy just a sandwich.

If anyone reading this thread decides to help out a stranger in need (or really anyone in need) after having read it, to me at least it's worth however many pats on the back the poster gives his or her self.\nTo be honest, I find complaining about these posts to be the same as complaining about other people getting Karma on Reddit. I'm speaking in general now so please don't take any of this as a personal attack against you. Karma is literally worthless and is only as valuable as each individual user makes it out to be to themselves.\nNow, some may argue that the posts which they don't personally like, and which are upvoted anyway, water down the content of the site. However, those people must also realize that Reddit has become an increasingly popular site, and that with a voting system, the majority will dictate the content that is upvoted. If those users really don't like it that badly, then they should either find a subreddit more tailored to their tastes, or even create their own where they and other like minded users can dictate the content they want to see.\nAgain, everything below the first paragraph was not directed toward you personally. Now I will also step down from my soap box and go about my day.\nTL;DR: Being nice to others can inspire others to also be nice to other people.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"The story: As a poor young college grad I splurged a little bit to fly home to the midwest for Labor day weekend to see family and celebrate by grandfather's 80th birthday and was scheduled to fly back to my home on the east coast on Tuesday. Unfortunately, I became very seriously ill (hospital, CAT scan, so sick I couldnt even use the internet!) over the weekend and was rather obviously forbidden from flying by my doctor. \n\nMy awesome mom took the lead and went down to the airport before my flight with documentation from my doctor and spoke to a customer service rep who assured her it wouldn't be any issue at all, said he was updating the information with a future fictitious date to keep the reservation open, and to call the 800 number to choose a new flight whenever I was well enough to return home. Mom leaves feeling great, shares the good news with me, and I spend the rest of the week slowly recovering, at least grateful that was one thing I didn't have to worry about.\n\nFast forward to today: After finally getting approval to fly from my doctor I spent an hour on the phone (much of it on hold) trying to get a flight back this weekend so I can go to work on Monday. \n\nLo and behold, first they say they have no record of the flight being anything other than a no show--luckily my mother had written down the name and time of the rep she had spoken to, at which point they change their story to \"oh, we have notes about it here, but not of the note your mother brought in, so that'll be $150 change penalty.\"After I argue on this point, since I have the letter right in front of me and the agent had seen it at the time, they agree to waive that, but at the very last step after choosing flights I am told it will be $270 due to fare differences because I am booking less than 14 days out, regardless of this being a rebooking of a medically delayed reservation. \n\nLook, I get you they need to make money somewhere, and that tickets typically cost more closer to the day of, but is screwing over sick people really the policy stance your company wants to have? The actual cost of me flying last Tuesday versus this weekend should be negligible to the airline, especially since there were many open seats available. \n\nI am so frustrated on the principle of the matter that I am considering booking a long haul bus back instead. Make me feel better about it by telling me when airlines have taken an already painful and stressful situation and made it worse.\n\nTL;DR: American Airlines hates sick people, disgusts me so much I will probably take a 30+ hour bus ride just to avoid giving them another dime. \n\nEdit: spelling","author":"MINENOTYOURS","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/zjaij\/today_american_airlines_told_me_it_would_be_270\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"887a4849ca16b52391353d094ca5aae2"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_zjaij"},{"body":"Seems to be about a certain policy of theirs which would make it a systematic victimization.

I recently upgraded from a r9 280 to an evga 980 and so far i've had nothing but issues. \n\nFirst thing i did was uninstall AMD drivers and ran guru3d's software to clean it up. Then i installed drivers for the 980. \n\nMy issue is horrible FPS. Whether it's Dayz, league, Witcher3 its all the same. Can't break 60fps and stuttering around 30-60.

Widing the clock up meant (literally) winching the weights up to the top of the case. Gravity then pulled them down, but they weren't in freefall: a mechanism called the \"escapement\" stopped the weights falling too fast, trapping the wheel they were driving and releasing it only briefly. [This diagram](http:\/\/www.tag-web-design.com\/websites\/marklavertonclocks\/Resources\/bwancescapement.jpg) shows an example of one type of escapement: as the pendulum swings from side to side, the \"anchor\" also swings from side to side, trapping the escapement wheel with each \"pallet\" in turn. Here's [a video of a longcase clock escapement in action](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wkO0iO5QC1M), and here's [a much more detailed video explaining how the escapement actually drives the pendulum](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z_7rE8afFfo) (because perpetual motion is not a thing).\n\nIn a longcase clock, the pendulum is roughly a metre long: in our gravity, anything a metre long will swing side to side in one second. Smaller clocks will have shorter pendulums which will swing faster, but everything is geared so that the hands move at the correct speed.\n\nSmaller clocks and watches will be powered by springs rather than weights: winding up one of these timepieces means tightening the spring, which then tries to unwind -- again, the escapement makes sure it unwinds at a specific speed. Anything too small to have a pendulum can instead be regulated by a balance wheel. It has its own spring, and as the clock mechanism tries to turn the balance wheel one way, it springs back and turns the other way. This means that the balance wheel -- and therefore the escapement -- oscillates at a very predictable rate.","post_depth":1,"author":"rewboss","majority_link":"t3_4frf7t","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_4frf7t","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_4frf7t","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_4frf7t","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_4frf7t","id":"t1_d2be89t"},{"body":"By how long it took a pendulum to swing back and forth.

A Pendulum swings back and forth at a fixed rate (or frequency - number of times over a given period of time). A spring will oscillate at a fixed rate. The magnitude of the motion - how far the pendulum swings - will become less as energy leaves the system, but the frequency of the oscillation is fixed. Think of a tuning fork. It can be louder or quieter but the frequency at which it vibrates is always the same.  \n\nThat regular motion is used to drive a mechanism called an [escapement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Escapement) which is used to turn the gears of the clock. In simplest terms the escapement is responsible for counting the cycles of the pendulum or spring.   \n\nThe pendulum goes back and forth at a given rate, say 4 times per second, and the escapement counts the number of times. Between the two of them you have a clock. This is fundamentally how all clocks work.  \n\nThis isn't confined to old clocks. The watch I'm wearing right now has no electronics in it, just springs and gears. It has a tiny spring in it that oscillates 6 times per second, which drives an escapement which drives the motion of the hands. This is not uncommon.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"Sorry for the novel :D\n\nHello \/r\/relationships[1] !\n\nI am not sure what to do anymore and thought I should post here for some advice.\n\nBackground: I was in a very exhausting relationship last year. It was the first time both of us were in a serious relationship and she got clingy almost instantly. We hung out literally everyday just watching youtube videos in my dorm room. One time I told her I was going somewhere, and she said she'll just wait for me in my dorm room... alone. I sometimes used to lie to her just so I can escape and actually have fun with my friends, heck it was my freshman year at college! She was also straight-edge, which isn't a bad thing but she would always judge me and my friends for drinking\/smoking.\n\nShe was just so dependent on me because of family issues too so I couldn't even break up with her at the time. Her clingy-ness has changed my outlook on relationships as I feel like every relationship is like that. I sometimes like to have alone time and to me you can't do that in a relationship. Whenever someone gets in a relationship, I feel as though they kind of like fuse together since they are always together.\n\n\n\nOk so fast-forward to a year later and I meet this really cool girl at a friend of mine's dorm party. I thought she was really hot and when we hooked up I almost couldn't believe it. We started texting and meeting up once in a while and hooking up. We didn't really make future plans and it was kind of like a friends-with-benefits situation.\n\nAfter about 2 month of hooking up, she finally asked \"Where do you see this going?\" I told her about my past relationship and that I just don't want to get in a relationship right now because of my suffocating ex. She seemed a bit hurt, but we kinda made up and everything seemed good at the time. We kept contact after school ended, even though I tried to limit the texting in order to not lead her on to a relationship. I thought it was just a hookup and didn't really care too much.\n\nI live on campus during the summer, and she told me she was going to be taking summer classes and that she will have a place over the summer. I went over to her place every week after my classes and we actually started to get kind of close and I started to like her more and more but we still only talked in person basically.\n\nThis is when things started looking a bit like a relationship as her friends kept referring to me as \"Jackie's BF\" and we were spending a lot of time together but I didn't care too much because I was only seeing her once a week rather than every second. Everything was dandy until yesterday when she basically said \"i can't do this anymore, i want a relationship\" to which I panicked and responded that I can't really take the next step. I think she was really hurt and we haven't really talked since. I can't help but think \"Did I do the right thing?\" every second of the day and I am looking for some advice\n\nWe have a lot of things in common and I really enjoy hanging out with her. However, she was also in a relationship for a long time and I'm afraid that it's going to have a similar ending. I was really miserable with my ex and I really don't want something like that again. I guess you can say I have commitment issues. Everyone has been giving me mixed responses and I am very confused on what to do.... Do I let her go and try to be friends with her later or actually attempt a relationship with her?\n\nTL;DR; : I [19M] have been seeing this girl [20F] for a couple of months but now she wants a relationship","author":"Octopus69","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/relationships\/comments\/1hos06\/she_20f_wants_a_relationship_i_19m_dont_know_what\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"887a4849ca16b52391353d094ca5aae2"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_1hos06"},{"body":"You shouldn't let bad experiences from the past prevent you from experiencing happiness in the future. \n\n\nHow much do you like this girl?

This process is random, but the average time it takes for this to happen is the same for all atoms of the same substance[1]. There are a few ways to express that average time, but one way is to look at the time it takes to have a 50% chance of decaying, and that's a \"half-life\".\n\nIf you have a lot of atoms - say, on the order of trillions, then the random behaviour starts looking more like an average behaviour. So if you start with a trillion atoms, after one half-life the number that will have decayed is very close to half a trillion (and the difference probably isn't worth measuring). After two half-lives, another half of the remaining atoms will have decayed, leaving you with a quarter of a trillion atoms of the original substance and three-quarters of a trillion worth of decay products[2].\n\nFor a small number of atoms, there's a decent probability that it won't be a perfect half-half split - like flipping coins until they show heads, if you've only got two then it won't be too surprising to get double heads in one flip even if heads-tails is more likely. But if you flip a trillion coins, it would be overwhelmingly unlikely that the number of heads would deviate from half a trillion by more than, say, a hundred thousand. So as long as your numbers are big, you don't need to look too much at the random side of the process, just at the average.\n\n[1] Specifically, all identical *isotopes*, i.e. atoms with the same proton-neutron configuration.\n[2] Some of which may have their own decay patterns, making the total make-up of what you have at this point complicated.","post_depth":1,"author":"conmanau","majority_link":"t3_1xk6pg","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1xk6pg","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1xk6pg","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1xk6pg","annotator":"1b6842f6994d0e1dd00c2b611793d268"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_1xk6pg","id":"t1_cfc31av"},{"body":"The time it takes for half of the material to be depleted.

I initially wanted mATX but I'm pretty sure that mITX is a better option now. For this reason I'm going with EVGA's Hadron Air. I'm looking for other case options if you have an idea but please also suggest a PSU since the Hadron comes with its own.\n\n*CPU & Mobo:* I'm choosing Z97 chipset so that I can upgrade more easily to something a little better in the future. Also the added Wifi is a bonus. For now though, I'm pretty curious to see for myself how the G3258 will do, given it's great price. I mostly play Guild Wars 2, Minecraft, Skyrim and Planetside 2. I think Planetside 2 will be the most demanding thing I'll be doing with my system (maybe some CAD or 3D design work later) and I would like to be able to play it at least fairly well - 1080p, High, ~60 FPS - I don't need Ultra.\n\n*Budget:* My budget was initially $650-700 (pre S&H and taxes) when I was not thinking about size but after realizing I'd probably need mITX, my budget is $750 CAN (before shipping and taxes and MIR)\n\nIn the future, I'd like to add an SSD, install an aftermarket CPU cooler and upgrade the CPU and\/or GPU\n\nThanks for reading this far! I'll answer any questions or comments you have below :)\n\nP.S.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"As we all know the hospital is not a fun place, many times you overhear stories that you wish you did not hear. I start, first time doing surgery, never really been in hospitals much so of course you are anxious and feel vulnerable. Scheduled for hip surgery due to a torn labrum \u2013 so here it starts.\n\nAfter arriving you disrobe and put all your belongings in a bag. Naked just covered with a gown \u2013 lets face it - its not hiding much and adding to your level of un-comfortableness. Now some feedback ahead of time, I like to trim in my private area, my wife prefers a bit of manliness down there while I love the feeling of being \u201call trimmed\u201d. Its been a while since my last trimming So imagine me, tender white dude, all anxious about first surgery, laying there what I could only describe as butt-naked in the bed, in a big room that is separated by blinds, not separated well enough I think. For the purpose of comedy, imagine a big black man entering the room, equipped with the tool of our trade, a trimmer (ok he was black but not that large). He gets ready to do his thing. As part of the hip surgery all hair has to be removed around the area. As he starts to trim away he enters the borders of the private zone. My wife in all her innocence says \u201cWell Honey, isn\u2019t that what you always wanted?\u201d \u2013 Oh the terror. As the guy continued we exchanged eye contact for a brief second and I can only imagine what went on in his head, because mine said in an attempt to finish my wifes sentence \u201cyou mean a big black man shaving my junk\u201d. No words were spoken, but we both knew what was going on. Awkward\u2026\n\nNext, pre-op. Its eerie quiet in pre-op, just a bunch of people waiting to get cut open. Now like many others I have a thing with needles, but what you gonna do. So the anesthesiologist and his nurse come along. He comes over and says \u201cWe are going to have to give you a block into your back to minimize the pain after surgery\u201d \u2013 \u201cok, I have no idea what it is, but do you thing, I mean I cannot really say no right?\u201d. Now, when a doc comes to you and tells you about \u201csomething special\u201d I imagine it\u2019s not a simple procedure. I ask the doc if I am going to feel much, he said \u201cNah, we give you some stuff, you should not feel much\u201d (emphasis on should, the sweating starts).\n\nNurse comes along with a tray of 5 needles, the 5 needles were covered with a plastic bag. She picks it up the plastic bag and has a conversation \u201cOk I brought the 4-inch needle for the block\u201d. Now, said 4 inch needle looked extremely scary \u2013 that sucker was huge, not just the size but the width of the needle itself. It covered the entire tray. The doc responds \u201cWell, bring the 6 inch one instead, actually, no, get the 8-inch one\u201d \u2026. I was speechless. The nurse responds \u201cWell, I don\u2019t like the large ones as I sometimes go in too deep\u201d. At this point I am freaking out, wtf kind of process is this? The doc walks over to me, injects something into my IV and I am out \u2013 gone. \u201cYou idiots, why didn\u2019t you put me out 20 seconds earlier, I did NOT need to hear any of this\u201d.\n\nPost-op next, its around 2:00AM while I wake up for the first time. Drug induced with my leg connected to a machine that moves the leg constantly \u2013 just had surgery in that leg and the moving part is definitely not fun. She asked me \u201cHey, do you have to pee?\u201d \u2013 Now as you can imagine, peeing was the last thing on my mind \u2013 my main focus was on the pain thanks to said machine. I really did not feel like moving and having a nurse go into my private zone to pee while my right leg is moving up and down \u2013 an accident waiting to happen. \u201cNo I\u2019m good\u201d. She comes back at 3:00, \u201cHey, you have to pee?\u201d \u2013 \u201cnope all good thanks\u201d. She comes back at 4:00AM with a tea and a diet coke \u201cI brought you something to help you pee\u201d \u2013 \u201cNo I\u2019m good\u201d. She then responds \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t pee we have to put the catheter back in\u201d \u2013 now, I have heard this term before, but did not know what it meant until then. All of the sudden clarity in my brain came through and I just realized I had been violated \u201cCatheter back in?? WTH, I had no idea you guys put this in there, I looked the procedure up online and there was no mention of it\u201d. The nurse responds \u201cWell, I can imagine why they don\u2019t mention that part\u201d. I instantly reached for the bottle, stuck it down there, inserted the member and did my business \u2013 the fastest pee I ever had.\n\nEDIT: TL'DR: Dream fulfilled of being shaven by another man, 8 inch foreign object inserted into the back, unknowingly violated in the japs eye","author":"chaugner","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskReddit\/comments\/1dc1zo\/things_you_heard_while_at_the_hospital_you_wish\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"887a4849ca16b52391353d094ca5aae2"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_1dc1zo"},{"body":"The ending made me laugh. \n\nI guess mine would have to be \"We have to put him down.\" ","post_depth":1,"author":"AGermanShepherd","majority_link":"t3_1dc1zo","annotations":[{"second_type":"answer","main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_1dc1zo","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1dc1zo","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1dc1zo","annotator":"887a4849ca16b52391353d094ca5aae2"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_1dc1zo","id":"t1_c9ovafc"},{"body":"An old woman having some horrid diarrhea in the bed across from me.

He should pay special attention to your lane early and try and get at least one or two successful ganks off to get you going.","post_depth":1,"author":"insertSpork","majority_link":"t3_1k8dq9","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1k8dq9","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1k8dq9","annotator":"d0bf500c45ae7c1c08eb65ef0a4e48f9"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_1k8dq9","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_1k8dq9","id":"t1_cbmec87"},{"body":"Well, u can try ad quints, hybryd pene marks, to punish him early in range vs melle matchup (u can aa, he dont). \n\nAfter 6 u should actualy still trade with him.

If they are, you can turn around his R-Q combo because you wont be silenced and you can hit him with QW+AA's and it should do a pretty decent chunk of damage. Landing another QW should allow you to ult and kill him most of the time. If your not sure you can get your E's off in time, ask for early ganks. He can't really deal with them, and he can't exactly ask for ganks cause your Morgana and she's pretty much ungankable. \n\nAlso, constantly push. He can't push for squat so whenever he tries to roam, warn your teammates and shove the lane like mad. Often when I use Morg against a kassadin, his tower goes down SUPER early because he tried to roam and I pushed the tower hard. He can't farm under tower very well either so pushing him early has a ton of other benefits. \n\nOne item I like getting against Kass is Abyssal because it lowers his MR which is needed because of his passive and it also makes you more durable to his combos.

It is $40 more expensive, but considering the GT 730 basically isn't a video card, I think it's worth the cost.","post_depth":1,"author":"eatingpotatochips","majority_link":"t3_48pvdu","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_48pvdu","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_48pvdu","annotator":"d5b31a90453980e00563f529fc590228"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_48pvdu","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_48pvdu","id":"t1_d0ljrow"},{"body":"[deleted]","post_depth":2,"majority_link":"t1_d0ljlzy","annotations":[{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljlzy","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljlzy","annotator":"d5b31a90453980e00563f529fc590228"},{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljlzy","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"negativereaction","in_reply_to":"t1_d0ljlzy","id":"t1_d0ljsp8"},{"body":"huh? what was rude? me encouraging you to DIY, telling you it's easy?","post_depth":3,"author":"eckre","majority_link":"t1_d0ljsp8","annotations":[{"main_type":"negativereaction","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljsp8","annotator":"313010445cba4a591e2368269a150e9f"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljsp8","annotator":"d5b31a90453980e00563f529fc590228"},{"second_type":"negativereaction","main_type":"question","link_to_post":"t1_d0ljsp8","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"}],"majority_type":"question","in_reply_to":"t1_d0ljsp8","id":"t1_d0ljwub"}],"subreddit":"buildapc","title":"XPS 8900 vs Build.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"For a long time, there have been 3 dominant Arena classes: **Rogue, Mage and Paladin.** Now, win statistics may vary per person so obviously this doesn't apply to everyone, but in general I think people will agree with this. \nThe weekly updated statistics posts of the top arena streamers back this up as well [as you can see here!](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1jck4WkEvaKWE0Iw9RrttLHoFO3KEMG6In6XS1okzmx4\/edit?pref=2&pli=1#gid=1595896034) (credit goes to \/u\/sexting_shakespeare)\n\nAs you can see on the spreadsheet doc, since the release of LoE (Nov. 12th), Rogue, Mage and Paladin not only have been the most played classes by these streamers, but they have the highest average winrate of 7.47, 7.11 and 7.00 respectively. Further down the list Druid averages 6.82, Warlock 6.46, Shaman 6.30, Priest 6.23, Warrior 6.11 and Hunter 6.04. \n\nIn my experience, Mage and Rogue have been top tier arena classes since Hearthstone's release. Other classes have been there at some point, but have fallen down gradually or significantly after expansions and adventures. For example, back in the days, Warrior and Shaman were pretty solid! Paladin was considered to be a pretty weak arena class at some point. But since the release of TgT Paladin has gotten better and better. In TgT Paladin got Seal of Champions, Argent Lance and Murloc Knight. LoE gave them Keeper of Uldaman. \n\nSo depending on whether you want to just have fun or play to win in Arena (which often goes hand in hand), you'll pick a class accordingly. I myself and I think a lot of arena players who read this, have experienced picking and facing a lot of Rogues, Mages and Paladins in arena for quite some time now. Getting as far as possible and receiving those shiny arena rewards after, makes Arena fun for me. Therefore, I will pick Rogue, Mage or Paladin whenever I can (and so do a lot of others). Druid hangs in there too. \n\nI think this is a problem. Over half of the Arena classes statistically should *not* be picked, if you want to win the most games. The difference between winrates maybe doesn't seem that high if you look at the spreadsheet numbers, but in reality it means a lot to constantly win less games. Also, when playing for example Shaman or Priest, you feel so helpless playing against these Rogues, Mages and Paladins over and over again and rarely facing a Warrior. \n\nSo when Blizzard introduced A New Way To Play, they stated that a couple cards from the Classic and Basic set were being looked at (balancing wise). They also made clear Arena is not affected by the new Standard format, as Arena will be using all the cards, thus being in the Wild format.\n\nWe know that the latest released Hearthstone cards get offered more than other cards (percentage wise), so it's entirely possible that the new expansion will (drastically) change things (because new cards have a greater chance to affect the Arena meta because they get offered more). On the other hand, Rogue and Mage have been top tier Arena classes for such a long time and didn't really get affected negatively by later card releases (you could even argue that Rogue and Mage have benefited from them which added to their power). \n\nDo you guys share these concerns? Are you confident this next expansion will make for a better, more balanced Arena experience, with more variety in class picks? Please discuss in the comments.

It's because the Rogue, Mage and Paladin have the highest winrates. That means that a lot of people are trying to get as many wins as possible. Because of this, you rarely see other classes being played. That sucks. It would be so much better for the Arena to have more viable picks if you *do* want to get the maximum wins possible and earn the most gold. \n\nAt the end I asked whether the people from this subreddit believe the new expansion could change this.

I imagine if I were to move to the dev side of things rather than the implementation side, I'd probably use even more of what I learned in college. It really depends on where you go and what you focus on!","post_depth":1,"author":"iresprite","majority_link":"t3_238lk9","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_238lk9","annotator":"d3ff34d503cec21ac13d39d7440d5490"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_238lk9","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_238lk9","annotator":"343090f214e68ce7f8a0c4111d6022ec"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_238lk9","id":"t1_cguix0a"},{"body":"I see.

In addition, I haven't seen it on newer laptops so it might not even be an option anymore.\n\nWhat is more likely happening is, most likely, that your power cord is on the fritz.  It has already probably done plenty of damage to your laptop.  The other poster said your battery is dying, however I do not believe this is the case - as typically it will just drain from 100 to 0 faster as it calibrates itself to the new maximum capacity.\n\nFor example - my wife's laptop (which is older than the one you have) would be unable to charge after her cord would stop supplying the appropriate voltage (while running).  If we left it powered off and plugged it in, it would get some charge but it destroyed the battery already so it lasts maybe 3 minutes (this was a few years ago, I'm not expecting a 5 year old battery to last very long but a young battery should).\n\nNo matter the case - if you have a dell, with dell installed software, you might have a thing called quick set which will automatically disable charging (to prevent the same issue my wife's had) when the voltage cannot be determined.  In addition, there is a rare chance that you (or someone else) disabled charging.\n\nYour best bet is to try a new power cord.  I would imagine your laptop isn't that old (Dell is still selling that unit) so you might want to check with dell as well, as this might be something they are better able to handle.  It may also fall under a warranty period and you may be able to get your battery and\/or cord replaced.

This is not entirely a bad thing, as the systems implemented to generate a more believable experience improved the quality of the games dramatically.  If you take Daggerfall, for instance, (Arena was similar) it is simply MASSIVE in scale, covering an area that games today still aspire to build.  Unfortunately, it was either static content (a few story-critical dungeons and towns) or completely RNG.  You could go back to the same spot twice and things would be completely different.  So yes, you had scale... you had exponentially more complexity (you could literally make spells that were the equivalent of the \"I WIN\" button with the right knowledge of how to do it), but mostly it was soulless.\n\nEnter Morrowind.  It's main questline was multitudes better than Oblivion and Skyrim.  It retained a much more complex skill and spell system, and generally was an improvement over Daggerfall.  It took out some of the needless scale and fluff, pushing the game engine to its limits without shackling the player to non-godlike status.  If you could dream it up, you could, in some way, make the spell and equipment that turned your playstyle into an absolute beast.  Still, however, the world felt a bit static.  It was beautiful, but NPCs were still along the lines of the classic \"stand there and hand out quests and information\" type.  Morrowind was like this giant playground based around the game engine with a fantastic set of plots (albeit buggy at times)\n\nOblivion changed that, adding Radiant AI.  This woke the world up and the NPCs actually did stuff.  It's now a given that a TES world will have a lot of things going on.  Encounters became less random and more emergent.  It did this, however, at the expense of game complexity.  NPCs were a bit more sentient and the player had to play by the same rules as the NPCs to make it anywhere near fair.  It was only a matter of time, and while Oblivion was a great game in its own right (I played hundreds of hours of it), it was far closer to the action RPG standard than the pen and paper RPG complexity of TES games before it.\n\nSkyrim cut the pen and paper fat further and added loads of great features that excited the masses.  It further distilled the experience into ARPG and I think it did this well.  But at this point, Skyrim is unrecognizable from its roots in Daggerfall and Morrowind.  It shares setting, story, and vision, but it is not the same game.\n\nIt is what it is... Oblivion and Skyrim were dumbed down for the masses and the 13 year old console gamers.  This age-old argument can be held elsewhere.  The fact for me, at least, is that all of the games represent the pinnacle of achievement for their respective generations.  I have played 400-500 hours between all of the games, dating back to DOS.  While I'm not an expert on any game in particular, I grew up with the series and despite the sacrifices made to complexity, Bethesda always seems to add enough to each iteration to make the TES series stand out from all of the other games being released at the time.","post_depth":1,"author":"tr0n42","majority_link":"t3_2q61x0","annotations":[{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_2q61x0","annotator":"d3ff34d503cec21ac13d39d7440d5490"},{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_2q61x0","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"},{"main_type":"agreement","link_to_post":"t3_2q61x0","annotator":"7447fd66d2d83d6577bce5cb0183b9ec"}],"majority_type":"elaboration","in_reply_to":"t3_2q61x0","id":"t1_cn3e1uu"},{"body":"Personally I think Morrowind is the best.\n\nSkyrim is easily one of the most bafflingly overrated games for me.

If you can't do that you're not truly omnipotent, but if your power can be stopped you're not omnipotent either. To be omnipotent is to be an unstoppable force and an immovable object.

But going back to the physical drives, the site you linked says:\n\n> If your blkid output does not include partition labels, this means that the partitions do not have labels and you will have to determine which partition you wish to mount by another means.\n\nwhich is the case for the drive in question.  Unfortunately the page doesn't seem to say what those other means are.  I assume it would involve the direct path, in my case \/dev\/sdd but i don't know the proper syntax to use.  Also, it seems to recognize a drive at first and then stop recognizing it when I swap out another.  So I will maybe have to restart if I want it to be able to read the drive again.\n\nAnother problem is that the drives are not showing up as type NTFS but rather type \"silicon_medley_raid_member\".

They walk you through how to find your device labels and create your own mount points for them.\n\nThe ID's on the drives might behave unusually because you're not hooking them directly into the system, you're hooking them up to an external adapter. The \"silicon_medley_raid_member\" may be some ID for the adapter, or a generic ID that it gives to drives it can't recognize.\n\nIt's pretty common for external adapters to behave oddly when you swap drives. You shouldn't have to restart the whole computer, just try unplugging the adapter, and connecting the next drive to it before plugging it back into the computer.\n\nEDIT: Just had another idea. If the drives report being \"raid_members\", they may indeed be just that, individual drives from a RAID array. If so, you won't be able to read any data from them without using the original RAID controller.

If so, and if you can stick to a budget well, I can say from experience you could pay this off in under 10 years, after which it's basically a heavily discounted apartment that you own.\n\nFYI, when budgeting for your home, you may want to take a look at a [Mortgage Amortization Calculator](http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/calculators\/mortgages\/amortization-calculator.aspx?loanAmount=60000&years=30.000&terms=360&interestRate=4.5&loanStartDate=08%2F15%2F2014&monthlyPayments=380.01&monthlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyAdditionalAmount=0&yearlyPaymentMonth=+Aug+&oneTimeAdditionalPayment=0&oneTimeAdditionalPaymentInMY=+Sep+2014&pDate=Aug+15%2C+2044&show=false).","post_depth":1,"author":"mnemoniker","majority_link":"t3_2dmwl8","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"7fb797ff47a1d1f7885b8a65fb20eaa2"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_2dmwl8","id":"t1_cjr52mf"},{"body":"Although not exactly the same, I posted a thread about this when I was in a verrrry similar situation about a year ago that got some great responses:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/personalfinance\/comments\/17wm6e\/25_years_old_35kyr_salary_am_i_crazy_for_wanting\/","post_depth":1,"author":"superhappywebguy","majority_link":"t3_2dmwl8","annotations":[{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"84d17254e707caa405b61fa2ba5ff02f"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"},{"main_type":"answer","link_to_post":"t3_2dmwl8","annotator":"7fb797ff47a1d1f7885b8a65fb20eaa2"}],"majority_type":"answer","in_reply_to":"t3_2dmwl8","id":"t1_cjr7454"},{"body":"I guess this all depends on where you live but in some areas, to get a loan to purchase a condo, you must put 20% down.

Consider a real life scenario, one I use to teach this. Real Jeep (the owner believed it was worth $35,000 at the time of purchase, but that is irrelevant) bought for $25,000 on a 5 year 0% loan, payments of $416\/month. 4 years later, the KBB value for private sale in great condition was $17,000. The owner still owes $5,000. Thus, he has systematically invested $416 a month, or $20,000, and turned it into $12,000. How many times does he need to do that to become a millionaire? If he had instead invested in mutual funds for those 4 years (we picked TSP for our example, which had averaged over 15% return in that time frame, but used 12% for our math), that $20,000 would have turned into $26,700. How many times do you have to do that to become a millionaire? Still a lot of times, but at least you are using your monthly cash flow to increase your wealth rather than waste it on something going down in value. Buy what you can afford with cash, and invest the rest to save for what you want to buy next.

It's not a bunch of neckbeards who dwell here every single day for the purpose of mocking religious people.\n\nInsulting, making fun of, or merely questioning one's religion is a very drastic step to take. \"There are two things friends don't talk about: politics and religion\"... this is a usual social rule that works most of the time. But this here is a public discussion board about atheism specifically, so it doesn't apply here, but don't expect the effects of putting one's religion on the spot to be any less severe. **People will get mad.** Redditors will get mad. They don't like their dogma to be poked and will preserve it like it's the untarnished picture of their loving mothers, some going as far out as to twist the violent words of the bible and many religious power figures, just so that they can still believe their faith is just. tl;dr: You will be called a neckbeard or a 14year old idiot. This is normal and expected.\n\nThis subreddit is a valuable resource for many who are having doubts, or are having trouble sorting out their feelings regarding their own religion. This is hard, you all know it is. That's why we need quality content to make people think, to let them know that we think as well. We are not teenagers who hate god just because, but instead most of us have come to a logical conclusion that god, the omnipotent presence that was described by many, doesn't exist in the way most think it does. I don't like it when people belittle our hard path of losing faith. It's not a chocolate vs vanilla choice, it's a drastic step in life. Most of us are \"agnostic atheists\", and we're proud that we don't know what's the exact origin of the universe, or what's the exact purpose of life. We won't make stuff up about it to make us feel good. As a consequence from our deconversions, I like to think we've developed more skeptical thinking than the general public. Not as many atheists purchase snake-oil treatments, believe in spiritual phenomena, find ET in our backyards, etc.\n\nThis is why this subreddit is necessary. Not only to promote positive atheism, but skeptical inquiry and good will.\n\nJust go easy on the memes, the Facebook dialogs or huge quotes. We need more news, calls for action, inspirational self posts, mind tickling questions, comedic material stemming from original content, debates, etc. This won't stop the ridicule from others, but it will make this subreddit better. I think it deserves to be better.\n\nAs always, [**READ THE FAQ**](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/atheism\/wiki\/faq).","post_depth":1,"author":"reads_the_faq","majority_link":"t3_1bkh9h","annotations":[{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_1bkh9h","annotator":"69fd9a3dad7cb11de711db4e9e0507bf"},{"main_type":"disagreement","link_to_post":"t3_1bkh9h","annotator":"38d643ea0762278cc21958fa2363041d"},{"main_type":"elaboration","link_to_post":"t3_1bkh9h","annotator":"e1474365f12144c30dbe712de11e0aca"}],"majority_type":"elaboration","in_reply_to":"t3_1bkh9h","id":"t1_c97tl0e"},{"body":"They want to believe all atheist are kids rebeling their parents.

The condemned was forced to ingest milk and honey to the point of developing a severe bowel movement and diarrhea, and more honey would be poured on him to attract insects, with special attention devoted to the eyes, ears, mouth, genitals, and anus. In some cases, the executioner would mix milk and honey and pour that mixture all over the victim. He would then be left to float on a stagnant pond or be exposed to the sun. The defenseless individual's feces accumulated within the container, attracting more insects which would eat and breed within his exposed flesh, which\u2014pursuant to interruption of the blood supply by burrowing insects\u2014became increasingly gangrenous. The individual would be lying there naked, covered from head to toe in milk, honey, and their own feces. The feeding would be repeated each day in some cases to prolong the torture, so that fatal dehydration or starvation did not occur. Death, when it eventually occurred, was probably due to a combination of dehydration, starvation and septic shock.

I also own AC.  \nFrom my perspective PCars is more arcade than AC.The driving is a bit more arcade than gran turismo. The force feedback is bad (about the same as GT), cars are too easy to drive, crashing into other cars has nearly no effect (most of the time the cars just drive straight on after a collision). It looks nice and it's fun to race.  \nAC on the other hand has a much much better force feedback, the cars are harder (and more realistic) to drive than PCars.

It has little micro potential and serves really only to add a bit more DPS to protoss armies. \n\nBut I think that's fine. Really the only use you see in modern times is in PvZ as a buffer between stargate openers and colossus based armies as a way to safely get that third up. You also occasionally see hatch or tech snipes with a pack of void-rays but those are pretty rare. The role as a support unit in the mid-game is served perfectly by the voidray, and because of it's slow movement speed it can be out-maneuvered by the faster zerg units. \n\nWhat I certainly do NOT want, is to see the void ray become a mainstay of protoss armies. I think collo-sentry-stalker vs hydra\/roach viper is much more interesting than seeing that wall of blue decimate whatever mediocre anti-air zerg decided to lose with. \n\nSo what do I want? Honestly, I'm not really sure. What I will say is that I'm interested to see how the nydus changes will effect the zerg mid-game. The ability to get in the main with some roaches more easily will allow the zerg to hit the protoss from more angles and make void-rays less effective in this scenario. \n\nSo really, we have to wait and see what else Blizz has planned for LOTV.

A Christian remains an atheist with regards to almost every god, but becomes an utter theist with regards to his own deity. Getting rid of almost all gods is utterly sensible \u2013 getting rid of that one final God is utterly incomprehensible.\n\nIn the same way, Libertarians, Objectivists and other minarchists feel that getting rid of 99% of existing government functions is utterly moral \u2013 but getting rid of that last 1% is utterly immoral!\n\nWe do not accept these reservations in other areas of our lives, which is enough to make us suspicious of the true motives behind such statements. A woman who is beaten up only once a month lives 99.99% of her life violence-free, but we would not consider her beatings acceptable on that ground. It would be even more ridiculous to say that a woman should not be beaten every day, but that it would be utterly immoral to also suggest that she should not be beaten at all.\n\n\"Those who claim that a reduction of violence is a moral ideal,but who then also claim that the elimination of violence would be a moral evil, must at least recognize, if they wish to retain any credibility, that they are proposing an entirely foolish contradiction.\n\nBy \u201cviolence\u201d here, I do not mean that anarchism will completely eliminate human violence \u2013 the violence that I am talking about here is the morally \u201cjustified\u201d and institutionalized initiation of force that is the foundation of State power.

Honestly, I've been down this road before, and it ended with me trying to off myself (not a good point in my life, but neither is this). I've been feeling like reality, the world, god, whatever you want to call it has been stopping me from doing something. In this case, going to school. I'm trying to get back in college, and honestly, I don't think I'd have much issue with it if it didn't feel like I was being stopped. \n\nAnytime I'm heading down to school, there's always something preventing me from getting there or succeeding. Normally, I'd chock this sort of thing up to coincidence, but considering how much it's happened, I'm starting to wonder. Been delayed by randomly appearing road construction. Car almost broke down halfway to school. Textbooks never in stock, not arriving in the mail when they're supposed to.\n\nI'm the *only* person in class who doesn't received a copy of the first assignment we're supposed to do. People giving me strange, worried, or annoyed looks everywhere I go in school. Despite being friendly, and trying to be socialable, everyone backs away from me or gets quiet around me. School systems not working, suddenly I can't log in to my math homework. Financial aid didn't get here in time, had to kindly ask my mother for a check to cover it until came in. Hell, I even took some random online quiz thing (put in a name, spits out some result based on your name) and it word for word said \"tooexistential73 will pass a chemistry test a long, long time from now\", with chemistry being my major. \n\nThey've gotta be coincidences, right? I mean, I guess I haven't been sleeping well, but it genuinely seems like I'm being held back, like I'm not supposed to succeed. I don't really believe in fate, and in most circumstances, I don't like it, but it just feels so off, like I'm being pushed in a different direction altogether.

{"is_self_post":1.0,"posts":[{"body":"Perhaps I'm blind but I've never seen this recommended. I generally browse \/r\/all. Multiple times every day I go to view what's new and I see the same post posted to 6-7 different subreddits, because that post generally has a valid claim to be in each of those such as health care stuff going to  Health, Politics and Obama. \n\n**Current problems:**\n1) The same post (not same topic, but literally same link and title and submitter) clutter up the new page\n2) Sometimes two of these same posts wind up on the front page. It's completely unnecessary to have two identical posts\n3) When posts like this make it to the front page, they often each of a fair number of comments, so reading comments in two separate links is frustrating and confuses things.\n4) Sometimes to get around this issue, I know some people will simply post it in just reddit.com so that it's more likely to be seen by the larger swath of people. I also know some people don't like having their reddit.com spammed with politics stuff.\n\n\n**Suggestion:**\nWhen submitting a link, allow more than one option in the \"reddit\" field separated by some delimiter. \n\nOnce posted, this would create a single post, that gets posted to each of those reddits, and instead of seeing \"submitted by magelisk to X\" you'd see 'submitted by magelisk to X, Y, Z....\"\n\nThis post would have one comments section which obviously makes it easy to follow the conversations. \n\n\n**Problems with the suggestion**\nProblems I foresee that I either don't know the answer to am unsure of what the end result will be.\n\n1) I'm not a fool, I'm sure it's not as easy as \"just doing it\". I've no doubt that there are back end architecture issues that might prevent this from being a simple implementations.\n\n2) These posts are probably more likely to generate comments from people not normally in your sub-reddit, which could lead to less of a circle jerk of 90% libertarian posts in what you're reading because no those Obama cool-aid drinking politics folks come in and muck up your orgy because now they see the same version as you. On the other hand, this probably isn't a bad things in a community that supposedly values discussion and criticism.\n\n3) People could try to use this feature to spam many reddits at once (like all of them) for whatever malicious (or good intentioned) purpose. \nPossible solution: require being subscribed to any reddit that you cross post to, or limit it to something like 10 or 15 reddits at a time. This sort of limitation would also help ensure that each links \"posted by A to x,y,z\" doesn't go so long that it destroys the generally neat format of the page\n\n4) Comments page needs to be re-done a bit since it will no longer be part of a particular reddit.\n\n5) I'm not really sure what this would do to self posts...\n\n\n*(Note: Before I get flamed for it, any subreddits i pick in examples is usually because of their popularity, not my opions on either, regardless of how I may seem to demean them with my choice of things such as \"circle jerk\")*\n\ntl;dr version: Allow submitting a single link to multiple reddits at once to try to clean up the page and reduce the duplicate posts and separated comments\/conversations. \n\nAlright, feel free to tear this apart now :)","author":"magelisk","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/reddit.com\/comments\/b4gzd\/reddit_feature_suggestion_cross_posting_support\/","majority_link":"none","annotations":[{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"887a4849ca16b52391353d094ca5aae2"},{"main_type":"announcement","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"f8484f2bc9b23a4f9dc9f441a85d5747"},{"main_type":"question","link_to_post":"none","annotator":"1791ac7859c3d5c7dd47b4eecada6cf1"}],"majority_type":"question","is_first_post":true,"id":"t3_b4gzd"},{"body":"Right, it'd be effectivly tagged.
